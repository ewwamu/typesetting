        Course Description
        Typesetting—the arrangement of letters into words, 
        words into lines of text, and lines of text into paragraphs—
        is a fundamental practice in typography. This research studio 
        will explore interventions in the technology of typesetting 
        with the goal of creating new visual forms or ways of working. 
        The course is organized around three areas of inquiry: How does 
        programming enable new ways of approaching conventional 
        typesetting? How can alternative interfaces suggest new conceptual 
        models for thinking about the arrangement of language? How does the 
        malleability of text on screens allow for more interactive or 
        dynamic type compositions? The course will combine collective 
        research into historical and contemporary precedents and 
        self-initiated projects exploring new ideas and techniques.
